# ESSF (Enterprise Software Security Framework)

The ESSF framework assists enterprises in clearly defining their software security boundaries and quantitatively evaluating security levels. It facilitates the establishment of a sustainable software security governance system through quantitative management, addressing the increasingly complex challenges in software security. To clearly define enterprise software security, it is essential to categorize the components of all software and their corresponding threat scenarios.
